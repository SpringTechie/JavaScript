variable are container for data.
In Js Dynamically type lang.
Mean we no need to declare data type of value while creating.
we can declare variable with diff data.
Example: isFollowing = false;
         isFollowing = 23
 console.log(isFollowing) // 23
Rules to create Variables:

1.Varibale names are case sensitive.
2.Only letters digits and alphabets and $,_ symbol are allowed 
3.First character should be _ or alphabet or $ are valid.
4.Reserved words cannot be variable names.


var,let ,const

var is the type of varibale before 2015 after intro of ES6 it is not recommned to use. Global scope
by using var we can declare the variable any number of types.
Ex:
var age = 23;
var age = 34;
var age = 45;

let :
varibale cannot be declared but can updated . A block scope.
Example:
let a; if we try print this o/p is undefined
let age = 23;
 age = 34;
 age = 45

const(final) : only once declaration and cannot be updated. Block scope.
const age 23;
age = 34; // error
Best practise to declare const variable is declare varibale with capital letters

DataTypes: 
1.primitive(7) and non primitive 

1.number : it can store both whole and decimal numbers.
2.String: In double quotes.
3.Boolean : true or false
4.Undefined : Variable declared but not initialized let a;
5.null : Represents an empty or non-existent value let x = null;
6.Symbol :Introduced in ES6, unique and immutable.
7.BigInt : Used for large integers : let age = 123n

To know any data type of any variable 
use this function
typeof(age)

Non -primitive.
It is a collection of diff variables.

let st = {
    rollId: 1,
    name : "raja",
    isPresent : true

}
console.log(st["rollId"])
console.log(st.isPresent)
to update any value in object

st["name"] = "Raja Kumar";
st["rollId"] = st["rollId"] + 1;
