Functions : It has block of code used to perform any specific task.
Advantage: By using Function we can get code resuability.

Syntax to declare Function:

function <function_name>(parameters) {
    // sample code
}

to invoke any function we have follow this Syntax

function_name(arguments)

All variables inside a function are local variables meaning it can be accessed inside that function only.
Where js function are used?
1.When event occures.
2.When it is invoked from Js.
3.Self invoking or calling.

In js we can use functions as variables.
const minus = function sub(a,b) {
    return a-b;
}

console.log(minus(1,2))

if we call like this for above function we get the "NaN"
minus(); with empty args.

self invoking function:
(function() {
    // code
})();
