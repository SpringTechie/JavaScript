car1 = "volvo"
car2 = "hyndai"
car3 = "tata"
Arrays: It is used to store a group of values of same type or diff type.
cars = ["volvo","hyndai","tata"]
to empty Arrays:
items = []
to add values to empty Array
items[0] = "ball"
items[1] = "pen"
Arrays supports indexing concept (index starts from 0)

We create array by using new keyword
let ar = new Array("volvo","hyndai","tata")
This is not recomended way to create array

Accesing array elements
console.log(cars[2])
To update the values
cars[1] = "BMW"

The type if array is object.
Arrays store diff data type value:
Some Important methods:
let cars = ["volvo",45,"tata"]
to find the length of array we use : array.length
to convert an array to String we use: array.toString()
to find the value of array at particular index: array.at(3) // retunr value of specified index.
to join all values inside an array we use : array.join("*")
to add new element to existing array we use : array.push("benz")
to remove an element from array we use : array.pop() it removes last element of array.
to remove first element inside an array we use : cars.shift() : 
to add new value at first position we use : cars.unshift("benz"): this wont replace the existing value it just add this value at first postion and aleady existing value is moved to next position.
to concat two strings:
to delete any item from array we use : delete array[index_number]: this is not recomended because it creates empty holes.
to copy any element into another position we use copyWithin(): 
to flat an array we use : array.flat()
to extract any part of values from list we use: array.slice(0,2) : startindex to endIndex-1
