Loops: used to iterate over array or to traverse from one position to another position.

types of loops:
1. for loop: loops through a block of code a number times.
             use this loop when we know starting and ending value.
2. for/in loop :  used to iterate over properties of object.
3. for/of loop : used to iterate over collections(array,Strings)
4. while loop : used to iterate over array or to traverse from one position to another position.
                use this loop when you dont know end condition.
5. do while: used to execute condition atleast one.

break: it will break the loop based on some condition.
continue: It skip the iteration based on condition.
