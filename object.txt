Object In Js : A group of properties is called Object.
1.Using an Object Literal
 by using curly braces with key value pairs, separted by colons 
 empty object : const person = {};

2.Using the new Keyword:
  const person = new Object();
  In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

How to acces the object in JS:
let person = {

}
1.person.fieldName;
2.person["fieldName"]

to add any new property...
person.nation = "india"

to delete any property
delete person.name;
delete person["name]

Nested Objects: An objects conatins another object isnide it.

person {
  name: "arun",
  car : {
    price:34
  }
}

Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
let person =  {
    id : 1,
    lastname: "arun",
    firstname:"kumar",
    isPresent : true,
    fullName : function() {
        return this.firstname + this.lastname;
    },
}
person.fullName();

How to display objects on UI?
document.getElementById("demo).innerHTML = person

when we looping on person object we need use object[x];
for(x in person)
 {
   here x mean a key represented in double qotes
   console.log(person[x])
 }
 second way to object?
 By using Object.entries(person)
 *** Using an Object Constructor
If we want to create my objects of person we can do this by using constructor funtion.

function Person(id,name,age) {
  this.id = id,
  this.name = name,
  this.age = age;
}
const mother = new Person(1,"amma",23);
const father = new Person(2,"nana",34);
Note : these obejects are mutable meaning we can new property to it.
father.nation = "india" it mean only add nation prop to that father object.
if we try to add new prop to Constructor function it will throw error.
example: Person.nation= "india"
To add any new prop to constructor  we do this way
Person.prototype.nation = "india"
All objects that are created using Constructor inherit the nation property
that code means that wont add any new prop to Person constructor, it add prototype object.
When we search for mother.nation first it will check in main objwct with taht key , if not present itchecks inside 
prototype object.
to override that value
mother.nation = "AUS"
**********
Use object literals {} instead of new Object().

Use array literals [] instead of new Array().

Use pattern literals /()/ instead of new RegExp().

Use function expressions () {} instead of new Function().
How to create Object?

Using an Object Literal
Using the new Keyword
const person = new Object();

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
Using an Object Constructor




Objects are objects
Maths are objects
Functions are objects
Dates are objects
Arrays are objects
Maps are objects
Sets are objects
3.Using an Object Constructor

Some Imp Object class methods..
The Object.assign() method copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
Object.assign(person2,person) // assign(target,source) copies 
The Object.create(person) creates an object from an existing object.
let person2 = Object.create(person) 
whenever we ttry to log person2 object it shows empty because log method will show prop that are belong to
peron2 object , not the inherited one.
To see the prop inside the peron2 use person2.name;

"use strict"
// Create Object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Freeze Object
Object.freeze(person)

// This will throw an error
person.age = 51;

Object.preventExtensions() allows modifications, but prevents addition of properties.

Object.seal() allows modifications, but prevents additions and deletions of properties.

Object.freeze() prevents modifications, additions and deletions of properties.
